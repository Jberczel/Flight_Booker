##Project: Flight Booker


My implementation of the Flight Booker project from the Odin Curriculum.

Project focus: building advanced forms with search and nested attributes.

##Objective
>In this project, you'll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you'll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book.

Build a flight booker, where user selects flight based on date, departure and arrival airports, and # of passengers.  User enters passenger detail on booking page and receives confirmation.
